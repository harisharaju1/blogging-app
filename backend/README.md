### Basic CRUD app with JWT auth

### Things that were new to me :

#### - for JWT, we're using the _jwt/hono_ package instead of the _jwt_ package

#### - Prisma felt similar to any other ORM, like EF; with differences in configuration and setup steps

#### all other functionality implementation felt familiar; next steps will be validating the input received for signup, and deploying this backend server
